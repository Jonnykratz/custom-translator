  <p #paragraph>Microservice architecture is a very popular approach in designing and implementing highly scalable web applications. Communication within a monolithic application between components is usually based on method or function calls within the same process. A microservicesâ€‘based application, on the other hand, is a distributed system running on multiple machines.</p>

<!--  <p #paragraph2>Communication between these microservices is important in order to have a stable and scalable system. There are multiple ways to do this. Message-based communication is one way to do this reliably.</p>-->
<!--  <p #paragraph3>When using messaging, components interact with each other by asynchronously exchanging messages. Messages are exchanged through channels.</p>-->
